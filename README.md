## Introduction
Weather stations data collection has been a tool that has benefited many outdoor uses for identification of surrounding environments for even many more applications. With high demands in its use, demands for higher quality data and precision only continue to evolve. Hence, the team identified that applications of these increasingly improving technologies could be applied more towards indoor uses. This project follows such applications, specifically from inspirations from humidifiers.

## Team Organization
### Team Goals
* Create a durable and functional prototype that would satisfy the projected clients.
* Learn from and quickly adapt to failures or unexpected changes throughout the development.
* Communicate ideas within the group successfully and respectfully that can accommodate everyone's interests as best possible.
* Better understanding the engineering process from start to finish with an actual stakeholder.
* Delivering a final product on time that we can showcase on our portfolio and resume
* Creating a device that will be used for years.

### Mission Statement
Bringing a kit car with a sensor detecting the weather. Itâ€™s meaningful for children to have a kit like that for engineering and astronomy education.
