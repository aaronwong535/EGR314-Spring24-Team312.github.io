## Introduction
Weather stations data collection has been a tool that has benefited many outdoor uses for identification of surrounding environments for even many more applications. With high demands in its use, demands for higher quality data and precision only continue to evolve. Hence, the team identified that applications of these increasingly improving technologies could be applied more towards indoor uses. This project follows such applications, specifically from inspirations from humidifiers.
